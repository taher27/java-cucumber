ROOST_METHOD_HASH=sayHello_52ad62746f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=sayHello_26998730d5

Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test

Details:
    TestName: testSayHelloBasicFunctionality.
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the sayHello() method returns the correct string "Hello World!".
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string "Hello World!".
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method is working as expected and returning the correct string. If the test passes, it confirms the basic functionality of the sayHello() method.

Scenario 2: Non-null Test

Details:
    TestName: testSayHelloNonNull.
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the sayHello() method returns a non-null string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the returned string is not null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method is not returning a null value. If the test passes, it confirms that the sayHello() method is correctly initialized and able to return a value.

Scenario 3: Consistent Return Test

Details:
    TestName: testSayHelloConsistentReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the sayHello() method consistently returns the same string "Hello World!" over multiple invocations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results of each invocation against the expected string "Hello World!".
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method consistently returns the same string. If the test passes, it confirms the reliability and consistency of the sayHello() method.
