ROOST_METHOD_HASH=sayHello_52ad62746f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=sayHello_26998730d5

Scenario 1: Test to verify if the method returns 'Hello World!'

Details:
    TestName: verifySayHelloReturnValue.
    Description: This test aims to verify the return value of the sayHello() method. The expected return value is "Hello World!".
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks as the method does not take any arguments.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual return value with the expected return value "Hello World!".
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello() method is returning the correct string. The expected result is "Hello World!" because this is the hardcoded return value in the method. This test is significant to ensure the correct functioning of the sayHello() method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify if the method returns a non-null value

Details:
    TestName: verifySayHelloReturnNonNullValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the sayHello() method returns a non-null value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks as the method does not take any arguments.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is not null.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello() method is not returning a null value. This test is significant to ensure the method is not returning null, which could lead to NullPointerExceptions in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to verify if the method returns a string

Details:
    TestName: verifySayHelloReturnString.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the sayHello() method returns a string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data or mocks as the method does not take any arguments.
    Act: Invoke the sayHello() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return value is an instance of the String class.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the sayHello() method is returning a string. This test is significant to ensure the method is returning the expected data type.
