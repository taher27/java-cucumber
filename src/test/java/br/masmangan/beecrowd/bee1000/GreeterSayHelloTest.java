================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No Vulnerability Detected
Issue: The submitted code is a simple method that returns a static string. It does not interact with any files, databases, or network resources. It also does not use any third-party libraries. Therefore, it does not present any typical security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), XML External Entity (XXE) Injection, Insecure Deserialization, etc.
Solution: N/A

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for correct return value

Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnValue
  Description: This test will verify if the method sayHello() returns the correct value "Hello World!".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required because the method doesn't require any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Verify if the returned value is equal to "Hello World!".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method sayHello() is returning the correct value. The expected result is "Hello World!" because that's what the method should return. This test is significant because it ensures the basic functionality of the method sayHello().

Scenario 2: Test for correct return type

Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnType
  Description: This test will verify if the method sayHello() returns a string type value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required because the method doesn't require any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Verify if the returned value is an instance of the String class.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method sayHello() is returning a string type value. The expected result is true because the method should return a string. This test is significant because it ensures that the method sayHello() is returning the correct type of value.

Scenario 3: Test for null return value

Details:
  TestName: testSayHelloNullReturnValue
  Description: This test will verify if the method sayHello() returns a non-null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required because the method doesn't require any parameters.
  Act: Call the sayHello() method.
  Assert: Verify if the returned value is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method sayHello() is not returning a null value. The expected result is not null because the method should return "Hello World!". This test is significant because it ensures that the method sayHello() is not returning a null value.
