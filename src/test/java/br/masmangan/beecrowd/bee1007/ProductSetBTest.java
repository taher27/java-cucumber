Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Value of B is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly sets the value of the integer 'b'. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with a valid integer as parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a valid integer value.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the initialized integer.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the value of 'b' is correctly set by the 'setB' method. The expected result is the initialized integer. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'setB' method correctly sets the value of 'b' according to the business logic.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the Value of B is Reset

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsReset
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly resets the value of the integer 'b'. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with zero as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the integer value as zero.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the value of 'b' is correctly reset by the 'setB' method. The expected result is zero. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'setB' method can correctly reset the value of 'b' according to the business logic.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if the Value of B is Set as a Negative Integer

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsSetAsNegativeInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly sets the value of the integer 'b' as a negative number. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with a negative integer as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative integer value.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized negative integer.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'b' against the initialized negative integer.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the value of 'b' is correctly set as a negative number by the 'setB' method. The expected result is the initialized negative integer. The significance of this test is to ensure that the 'setB' method correctly sets the value of 'b' as a negative number according to the business logic.
