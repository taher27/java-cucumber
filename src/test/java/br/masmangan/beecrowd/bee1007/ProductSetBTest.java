================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Encapsulation Violation
Issue: The setB(int b) method directly manipulates the 'b' attribute. This can lead to a violation of data encapsulation, a key principle of object-oriented programming. It can lead to unauthorized access and modification of the attribute, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
Solution: To resolve this issue, it is recommended to use a more secure encapsulation pattern. This could involve making the 'b' attribute private and providing getter and setter methods for it. The setter method should include validation checks to ensure that only valid data is set.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The setB(int b) method does not validate the input 'b'. This can lead to unexpected behavior if incorrect data is provided. For example, if 'b' is expected to be a positive integer, negative integers or zero may cause problems.
Solution: To mitigate this, include input validation checks in the setB(int b) method. This could involve checking that 'b' is within an expected range or meets other requirements before setting it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Check if setB is Setting the Correct Value

Details:
    TestName: testSetBCorrectValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB is correctly setting the value of b.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a certain value.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with the initialized variable.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the value of b with the initial value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setB method is correctly setting the value of b. The expected outcome is that the initial value and the value of b after the setB method is invoked should be the same. This test is significant to ensure the correct functionality of the setB method.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if setB is Handling Negative Values

Details:
    TestName: testSetBNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB is correctly handling negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with a negative value.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with the initialized variable.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the value of b with the initial negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setB method is correctly handling and setting negative values. The expected outcome is that the initial negative value and the value of b after the setB method is invoked should be the same. This test is significant to ensure the correct functionality of the setB method when handling negative values.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if setB is Handling Zero

Details:
    TestName: testSetBZero.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method setB is correctly handling zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a variable with zero.
    Act: Invoke the setB method with the initialized variable.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the value of b with zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the setB method is correctly handling and setting zero. The expected outcome is that the value of b after the setB method is invoked should be zero. This test is significant to ensure the correct functionality of the setB method when handling zero.
