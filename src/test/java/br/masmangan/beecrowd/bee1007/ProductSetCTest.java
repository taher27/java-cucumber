Scenario 1: Test setting a positive integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingPositiveIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a positive integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a positive integer value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to the positive integer value passed as a parameter.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the setC method accurately sets the value of 'c' to a positive integer. This is significant as it demonstrates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test setting a negative integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingNegativeIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a negative integer value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to the negative integer value passed as a parameter.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the setC method accurately sets the value of 'c' to a negative integer. This is significant as it demonstrates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 3: Test setting a zero value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingZeroValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a zero value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with zero as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the setC method accurately sets the value of 'c' to zero. This is significant as it demonstrates the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Test setting maximum integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingMaxIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with Integer.MAX_VALUE as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the setC method accurately sets the value of 'c' to the maximum integer value. This is crucial for ensuring the method can handle the upper limit.

Scenario 5: Test setting minimum integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingMinIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set the minimum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with Integer.MIN_VALUE as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to Integer.MIN_VALUE.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to validate that the setC method accurately sets the value of 'c' to the minimum integer value. This is crucial for ensuring the method can handle the lower limit.
