================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method accepts any integer value without validation. If the variable 'c' is used without proper validation elsewhere in the code, it could lead to security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Implement checks to ensure the value of 'c' falls within expected ranges.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the variable 'c' holds sensitive information, the setter method could potentially expose this information to other classes or methods.
Solution: Limit the accessibility of sensitive variables. Consider using getter and setter methods only when necessary, and avoid exposing sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the setter is only used for debugging and accidentally left in the production code, it can provide an attack vector.
Solution: Ensure to remove debugging code or guard it with a flag that is disabled in production.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test setting a positive integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingPositiveIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a positive integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a positive integer value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to the positive integer value passed to the setC method.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setC method correctly sets the value of 'c' to a positive integer. This is essential for ensuring the correct operation of the class when 'c' is used in computations or logic.

Scenario 2: Test setting a negative integer value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingNegativeIntegerValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a negative integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a negative integer value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to the negative integer value passed to the setC method.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setC method correctly sets the value of 'c' to a negative integer. This is essential for ensuring the correct operation of the class when 'c' is used in computations or logic.

Scenario 3: Test setting a zero value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingZeroValue
  Description: This test is designed to validate the ability of the setC method to set a zero value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an object of the class containing the setC method.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a zero value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of 'c' in the object is equal to zero.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the setC method correctly sets the value of 'c' to zero. This is important for ensuring the correct operation of the class when 'c' is used in computations or logic, particularly in scenarios where dividing by 'c' could lead to an arithmetic exception.
