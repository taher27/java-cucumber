Scenario 1: Test to Check if setD is Setting the Correct Value

Details:
    TestName: testSetDWithPositiveNumber.
    Description: This test will check if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd' when a positive number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class that contains the setD method.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with a positive number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'd' value is set to the passed positive number.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd'. The expected result is that 'd' should be equal to the positive number passed to the setD method. This test is significant as it ensures the functionality of the setD method.

Scenario 2: Test to Check setD with Zero

Details:
    TestName: testSetDWithZero.
    Description: This test will check if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd' when zero is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class that contains the setD method.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'd' value is set to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd' when zero is passed. The expected result is that 'd' should be equal to zero. This test is significant as it validates the behavior of the setD method when zero is passed.

Scenario 3: Test to Check setD with Negative Number

Details:
    TestName: testSetDWithNegativeNumber.
    Description: This test will check if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd' when a negative number is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class that contains the setD method.
    Act: Invoke the setD method with a negative number.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the 'd' value is set to the passed negative number.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the setD method correctly sets the value of 'd' when a negative number is passed. The expected result is that 'd' should be equal to the negative number passed. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the setD method with negative numbers.
