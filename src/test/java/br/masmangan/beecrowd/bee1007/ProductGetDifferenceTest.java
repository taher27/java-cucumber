================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The multiplication operations in the getDifference() method can cause an integer overflow if 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd' are large enough. This can lead to incorrect results and potentially exploitable conditions.
Solution: Consider using Java's BigInteger class or add checks to ensure the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' do not cause an overflow.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The getDifference() method does not validate the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. If these values are provided by an untrusted source, it could lead to exploitation.
Solution: Validate all inputs to the getDifference() method to ensure they are within expected ranges and types.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the values of 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are used for debugging and not removed in the production environment, it could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure no debug code is left in the production environment, or use proper logging mechanisms that can be turned off or configured for different levels of verbosity.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for positive integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetDifferenceWithPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getDifference method when all the input parameters are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set all the integers (a, b, c, d) to positive values.
  Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when all inputs are positive integers. The significance of this test is to ensure the basic mathematical operation of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for negative integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetDifferenceWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getDifference method when all the input parameters are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set all the integers (a, b, c, d) to negative values.
  Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when all inputs are negative integers. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for zero values

Details:
  TestName: testGetDifferenceWithZeroValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getDifference method when one or more input parameters are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one or more integers (a, b, c, d) to zero.
  Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when one or more inputs are zero. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles zero values correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for large integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetDifferenceWithLargeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getDifference method when all the input parameters are very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set all the integers (a, b, c, d) to large values.
  Act: Invoke the getDifference method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the expected difference.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the difference when all inputs are very large integers. This test is significant to ensure that the method can handle large numbers without overflow.
