ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getProduct_630a0cff5b

Scenario 1: Test for Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testProductOfPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the product of two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set two positive numbers using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct() method.
  Assert: Assert that the product of the two positive numbers is equal to the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correct calculation of the product. This test verifies the basic functionality of the getProduct() method.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testProductOfNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the product of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set two negative numbers using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct() method.
  Assert: Assert that the product of the two negative numbers is equal to the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correct calculation of the product when both numbers are negative. This test verifies the functionality of the getProduct() method when dealing with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for Zero
Details:
  TestName: testProductOfZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the product when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one number as zero and the other as a non-zero number using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct() method.
  Assert: Assert that the product is zero.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correct calculation of the product when one of the numbers is zero. This test verifies the functionality of the getProduct() method when dealing with zero.

Scenario 4: Test for Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: testProductOfLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the product when both numbers are large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set two large numbers using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct() method.
  Assert: Assert that the product of the two large numbers is equal to the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correct calculation of the product when both numbers are large. This test verifies the functionality of the getProduct() method when dealing with large numbers.

Scenario 5: Test for One Positive and One Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: testProductOfPositiveAndNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the product when one number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set one number as positive and the other as negative using setA() and setB() methods.
  Act: Invoke the getProduct() method.
  Assert: Assert that the product of the positive and negative numbers is negative.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correct calculation of the product when one number is positive and the other is negative. This test verifies the functionality of the getProduct() method when dealing with positive and negative numbers.
