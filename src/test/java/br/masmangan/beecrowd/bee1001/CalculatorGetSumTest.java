Scenario 1: Test to get the sum of two positive integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum() method when two positive integers are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set the values of a and b to positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum with the expected sum.
Validation:
  Verify that the getSum() method correctly adds two positive integers. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addition operation.

Scenario 2: Test to get the sum of a positive and a negative integer

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveAndNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum() method when one positive and one negative integer are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set the values of a and b to one positive and one negative integer respectively.
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum with the expected sum.
Validation:
  Verify that the getSum() method correctly adds a positive and a negative integer. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the addition operation with different signs.

Scenario 3: Test to get the sum of two negative integers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum() method when two negative integers are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set the values of a and b to negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum with the expected sum.
Validation:
  Verify that the getSum() method correctly adds two negative integers. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the addition operation with negative numbers.

Scenario 4: Test to get the sum of a number and zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSum() method when one of the numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the setA() and setB() methods to set the values of a and b to a number and zero respectively.
  Act: Invoke the getSum() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum with the expected sum.
Validation:
  Verify that the getSum() method correctly adds a number and zero. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the addition operation when one of the numbers is zero.
