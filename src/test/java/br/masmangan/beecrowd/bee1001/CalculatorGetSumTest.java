================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The submitted code snippet does not have any debug code, logging statements, or commented-out code. However, these are common in development stages and can sometimes be forgotten and left in production code. This can expose sensitive information or system details that can be exploited by attackers.
Solution: Always remove debug code or logging statements containing sensitive information before moving to the production environment. Use logging levels to control what information is logged in different environments.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code snippet does not handle the case where the variables 'a' or 'b' could be null. This could lead to a NullPointerException being thrown at runtime, potentially causing a system crash or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always check if an object is null before trying to use it. This can be done using an if statement or a ternary operator.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
Issue: The code snippet does not perform any security checks or validate the inputs 'a' and 'b'. This could allow for unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
Solution: Implement proper security measures such as authentication and authorization checks. Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The code snippet does not handle the case where the sum of 'a' and 'b' could exceed the maximum value for an int, leading to an overflow and incorrect results.
Solution: Use appropriate data types that can handle the expected range of values. Implement checks to prevent or handle overflows.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with positive numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to validate the getSum method when both input numbers are positive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds two positive numbers. This is important to ensure the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test with negative numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to validate the getSum method when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds two negative numbers. This is important to ensure the method's capability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is designed to validate the getSum method when one or both input numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one or both integers as zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method with the integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds numbers when one or both are zero. This is important to ensure the method's ability to handle zero as an input.

Scenario 4: Test with large numbers

Details:  
  TestName: testGetSumWithLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to validate the getSum method when both input numbers are large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large integers.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method with the two large integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two large numbers.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds two large numbers. This is important to ensure the method's capability to handle large numbers without overflow issues.
