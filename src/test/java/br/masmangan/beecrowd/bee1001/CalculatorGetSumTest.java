ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Given the method `getSum` lacks direct parameter inputs within its definition and relies on external variables `a` and `b`, we'll assume these variables are class-level fields. Test scenarios will be designed with the assumption that we can manipulate or set `a` and `b` before calling `getSum`.

### Scenario 1: Positive Numbers Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfPositiveNumbers
Description: This test checks the basic addition functionality when both a and b are positive integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to 5 and `b` to 3.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 8.
Validation:
The assertion validates that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is crucial for ensuring the basic arithmetic operation of addition is correctly implemented in the application.

### Scenario 2: Negative Numbers Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfNegativeNumbers
Description: This test verifies the method can correctly add two negative numbers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to -5 and `b` to -3.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is -8.
Validation:
The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles the addition of negative numbers, which is essential for comprehensive arithmetic operation support.

### Scenario 3: Positive and Negative Number Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfPositiveAndNegativeNumber
Description: This test checks the method's ability to add a positive number to a negative number correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to 5 and `b` to -3.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 2.
Validation:
This test ensures that the method can handle different signs in its operands correctly, which is crucial for accurate mathematical calculations.

### Scenario 4: Addition Resulting in Zero

Details:
TestName: additionResultingInZero
Description: This scenario tests the method's ability to accurately add two numbers that result in zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to 3 and `b` to -3.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the method can correctly add two numbers where the result is zero, validating the method's handling of scenarios that result in no net change.

### Scenario 5: Addition of Zeroes

Details:
TestName: additionOfZeroes
Description: This test verifies the method's behavior when adding two zeroes.
Execution:
Arrange: Set both `a` and `b` to 0.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
Validation:
The assertion ensures that the method can handle adding two zeroes, which is a basic but essential functionality for any addition operation.

### Scenario 6: Large Integer Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfLargeIntegers
Description: Tests the method's ability to handle the addition of large integers, potentially testing the limits of the integer range.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to Integer.MAX_VALUE and `b` to 1.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is Integer.MIN_VALUE (due to overflow).
Validation:
This test checks for integer overflow handling, which is critical for applications that may deal with large numbers, ensuring the method behaves predictably even in overflow scenarios.

### Scenario 7: Addition With One Operand as Zero

Details:
TestName: additionWithOneOperandAsZero
Description: This scenario tests adding a non-zero number to zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to 0 and `b` to 5.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 5.
Validation:
The assertion validates that the method can handle cases where one of the operands is zero, ensuring the method's versatility and correctness in simple arithmetic operations.
