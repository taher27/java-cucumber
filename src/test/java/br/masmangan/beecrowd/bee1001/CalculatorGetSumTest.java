================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uninitialized Variables
Issue: The variables 'a' and 'b' are not defined within the function or class. If they are not initialized before the function is called, this could lead to unexpected behavior or a NullPointerException.
Solution: Ensure 'a' and 'b' are properly initialized before they are used within the function. If they are class variables, they should be declared and initialized within the class. If they are local variables, they should be passed as parameters to the function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with Positive Numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is designed to validate the getSum method when both input numbers are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive integers.
  Act: Call the getSum method with the two positive integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds two positive numbers. This is an important test as it checks the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test with Negative Numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative integers.
  Act: Call the getSum method with the two negative integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two negative numbers.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately adds two negative numbers. This is important to ensure that the method handles negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with Zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when one of the input numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one integer as zero and another integer with any value.
  Act: Call the getSum method with the two numbers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the same as the non-zero number.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getSum method correctly handles zero as an input, which is an important edge case to test.

Scenario 4: Test with Large Numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithLargeNumbers
  Description: This test validates the getSum method when both input numbers are very large.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two large integers.
  Act: Call the getSum method with the two large integers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two large numbers.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getSum method accurately handles large numbers. It's crucial to ensure that the method can handle a wide range of inputs without errors.

Scenario 5: Test with Mixed Sign Numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithMixedSignNumbers
  Description: This test checks the getSum method when one input number is positive and the other is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize one positive integer and one negative integer.
  Act: Call the getSum method with the two numbers.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the exact sum of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the getSum method correctly handles mixed sign numbers. It's important to ensure that the method can handle any combination of positive and negative numbers without errors.
