================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: This vulnerability can manifest when a Java application uses weak random number generators, which could potentially lead to predictable values and compromise security.
Solution: Use strong random number generators like java.security.SecureRandom instead of java.util.Random for generating random values in a security-sensitive context.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: This issue arises when a Java application uses string concatenation to construct SQL queries. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the queries.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by JDBC to mitigate the risk of SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: This vulnerability can occur when a Java web application does not properly validate or escape user input before displaying it on a webpage, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Use context-specific output encoding/escaping techniques before displaying user-supplied data. Java provides several libraries like OWASP Java Encoder for HTML encoding.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test will verify if the method correctly adds two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set values of 'a' and 'b' to positive numbers.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two positive numbers. This is the basic functionality of the method and it's important to ensure it works correctly.

Scenario 2: Test with negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test will verify if the method correctly adds two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set values of 'a' and 'b' to negative numbers.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds two negative numbers. This verifies that the method can handle negative numbers, which is a valid use case.

Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  TestName: testSumWithZero
  Description: This test will verify if the method correctly adds a number and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set value of 'a' to a number and 'b' to zero.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is equal to 'a'.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly adds a number and zero. This verifies that the method can handle zero as an input, which is a valid use case.

Scenario 4: Test with maximum integer values

Details:
  TestName: testSumWithMaxIntegers
  Description: This test will verify if the method handles the addition of two maximum integer values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set values of 'a' and 'b' to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Call the getSum() method.
  Assert: The result will be overflowed and not equal to the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles integer overflow correctly. This is important to ensure that the method behaves predictably when handling large numbers.
