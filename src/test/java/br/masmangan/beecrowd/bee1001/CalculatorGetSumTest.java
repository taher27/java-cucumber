ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Given the method `getSum` lacks direct parameter inputs within its definition and relies on external variables `a` and `b`, we'll assume these variables are class-level fields. Test scenarios will be designed with the assumption that we can set these variables either directly or through a constructor or setter methods before invoking `getSum`.

### Scenario 1: Positive Numbers Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfPositiveNumbers
Description: This test verifies that the method correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the class variables `a` and `b` to any positive integers, say 5 and 3.
Act: Invoke the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is equal to the sum of the two numbers, which is 8 in this case.
Validation:
This assertion validates that the method accurately performs addition on positive integers. It's significant for ensuring the method handles basic arithmetic operations correctly.

### Scenario 2: Negative Numbers Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfNegativeNumbers
Description: This test checks if the method correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize `a` and `b` with negative values, for example, -4 and -6.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Verify that the output equals the sum of the two numbers, which should be -10.
Validation:
This test ensures that the method can handle addition when both operands are negative, validating its correctness across different ranges of integers.

### Scenario 3: Zero Addition

Details:
TestName: additionWithZero
Description: Tests if adding zero to a number returns the original number.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` to any positive or negative integer, and `b` to 0.
Act: Execute the `getSum` method.
Assert: Confirm that the result is the same as the non-zero operand.
Validation:
This test is crucial for verifying the additive identity property of zero within the method's operation, a fundamental arithmetic rule.

### Scenario 4: Addition of Opposite Numbers

Details:
TestName: additionOfOpposites
Description: Ensures that adding a number and its negation yields zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Assign `a` and `b` as any integer and its negative counterpart, such as 7 and -7.
Act: Invoke the `getSum` method.
Assert: Check that the result is 0.
Validation:
This scenario tests the method's ability to handle cases where the sum of the operands should logically cancel out, validating the handling of additive inverses.

### Scenario 5: Large Numbers Addition

Details:
TestName: additionOfLargeNumbers
Description: Verifies that the method can accurately add very large integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set `a` and `b` to large values within the integer range, like 2,147,483,647 and 1.
Act: Call the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the method throws an appropriate exception or handles the overflow correctly.
Validation:
This test checks the method's robustness and its ability to manage or report integer overflow, a critical aspect of numerical computations in software applications.

### Scenario 6: Uninitialized Variables Addition

Details:
TestName: additionWithUninitializedVariables
Description: Attempts to add two uninitialized integers, assuming default initialization to 0.
Execution:
Arrange: Do not explicitly set `a` and `b`, relying on default initialization.
Act: Invoke the `getSum` method.
Assert: Assert that the result is 0, indicating both were initialized to 0 by default.
Validation:
This scenario ensures that the method can handle scenarios where its operands are not explicitly initialized, relying on language default values.

These scenarios collectively aim to validate the functionality of the `getSum` method across a range of inputs and conditions, ensuring its reliability and correctness in different operational contexts.
