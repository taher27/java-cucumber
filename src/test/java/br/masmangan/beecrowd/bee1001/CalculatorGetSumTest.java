ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getSum_61f2af7779
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSum_d38a33793d

Scenario 1: Validate getSum with positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to positive numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the sum of two positive numbers is calculated correctly. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers set. This test is significant as it validates the basic arithmetic operation in the application.

Scenario 2: Validate getSum with negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when both input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to negative numbers using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the sum of two negative numbers is calculated correctly. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers set. This test is significant as it validates the arithmetic operation with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Validate getSum with zero
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when one of the input numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a to any number and b to zero using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the sum of a number and zero is calculated correctly. The expected result is the number set in a. This test is significant as it validates the arithmetic operation with zero.

Scenario 4: Validate getSum with maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: testGetSumWithMaxIntValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the getSum method when the input numbers are maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a and b to maximum integer values using setA and setB methods.
  Act: Invoke the getSum method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual sum against the expected sum.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the sum of maximum integer values is calculated correctly. The expected result is the sum of the two numbers set. This test is significant as it validates the arithmetic operation with maximum integer values and checks for integer overflow.
