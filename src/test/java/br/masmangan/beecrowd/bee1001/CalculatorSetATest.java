================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Encapsulation Violation
Issue: The setA(int a) method directly manipulates the 'a' attribute. A malicious actor could exploit this to alter the 'a' attribute in undesired ways, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior.
Solution: Protect the 'a' attribute by making it private and ensuring it can only be manipulated through controlled methods. You may also want to add validation checks within the setA(int a) method to ensure only valid values can be assigned to 'a'.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Value of a is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfAIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly sets the value of the integer 'a'. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with a valid integer as parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setA' method with the initialized value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the value of 'a' is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'setA' method correctly sets the value of 'a'. The expected result is based on the fact that the 'setA' method should assign the value of 'a' to the parameter passed to it. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the 'setA' method.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the Value of a is Not Set Incorrectly

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfAIsNotSetIncorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' does not incorrectly set the value of the integer 'a'. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with a different value as parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setA' method with a different value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the value of 'a' is not equal to the initialized value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'setA' method does not incorrectly set the value of 'a'. The expected result is based on the fact that the 'setA' method should assign the value of 'a' to the parameter passed to it and not any other value. This test is significant as it prevents potential bugs related to incorrect assignment of values.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if the Value of a is Set with Negative Integer

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfAIsSetWithNegativeInteger
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly sets the value of the integer 'a' when passed a negative integer as parameter. The target scenario is when the method is invoked with a negative integer.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setA' method with the initialized negative value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the value of 'a' is equal to the initialized negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify if the 'setA' method correctly sets the value of 'a' even when passed a negative integer. The expected result is based on the fact that the 'setA' method should assign the value of 'a' to the parameter passed to it, regardless of it being positive or negative. This test is significant as it ensures the method's functionality with negative integers.
