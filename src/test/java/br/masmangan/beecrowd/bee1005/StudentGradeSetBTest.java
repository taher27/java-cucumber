  Scenario 1: Test for positive double value

  Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithPositiveValue
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method setB correctly assigns a positive double value to the variable b.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method doesn't depend on any data or mocks.
    Act: Invoke the method setB with a positive double value as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the value of b is equal to the parameter passed to setB.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setB correctly assigns the parameter value to the variable b when passed a positive double value. The test is significant in checking the basic functionality of the method.

  Scenario 2: Test for negative double value

  Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithNegativeValue
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method setB correctly assigns a negative double value to the variable b.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method doesn't depend on any data or mocks.
    Act: Invoke the method setB with a negative double value as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the value of b is equal to the parameter passed to setB.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setB correctly assigns the parameter value to the variable b when passed a negative double value. The test is significant in checking the basic functionality of the method.

  Scenario 3: Test for zero value

  Details:
    TestName: testSetBWithZeroValue
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method setB correctly assigns zero to the variable b.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as the method doesn't depend on any data or mocks.
    Act: Invoke the method setB with zero as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the value of b is equal to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setB correctly assigns zero to the variable b. The test is significant in checking the basic functionality of the method.
