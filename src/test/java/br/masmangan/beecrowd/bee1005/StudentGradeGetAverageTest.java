"""
Scenario 1: Test for Normal Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageCalculationForNormalValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when normal values are provided as inputs for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Use setA and setB to set values for a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the average calculation. The expected result is derived from manually calculating the average using the provided formula. This test is crucial to ensure the accurate calculation of the student's average grade.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageCalculationForZeroValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when zero is provided as inputs for both a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Use setA and setB to set zero for a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the average calculation when zero is provided as inputs. The expected result is zero as both a and b are zero. This test is important to ensure the method can handle zero inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageCalculationForNegativeValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when negative values are provided as inputs for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Use setA and setB to set negative values for a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the average calculation when negative values are provided as inputs. The expected result is derived from manually calculating the average using the provided formula. This test is important to ensure the method can handle negative inputs correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageCalculationForMaxValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the average calculation when maximum possible values are provided as inputs for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of StudentGrade. Use setA and setB to set maximum possible values for a and b.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the correctness of the average calculation when maximum values are provided as inputs. The expected result is derived from manually calculating the average using the provided formula. This test is important to ensure the method can handle maximum possible inputs correctly.
