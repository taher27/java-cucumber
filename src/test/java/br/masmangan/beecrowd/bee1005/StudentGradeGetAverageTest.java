"""
Scenario 1: Test for Normal Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNormalValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when normal values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set normal values (for example, a=2.0 and b=3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with normal values. The expected result is 3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the basic functionality of the getAverage method.

Scenario 2: Test for Zero Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithZeroValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when zero values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set zero values (for example, a=0.0 and b=0.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with zero values. The expected result is 0.0. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the student has scored zero in both the subjects.

Scenario 3: Test for Negative Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithNegativeValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when negative values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set negative values (for example, a=-2.0 and b=-3.0).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with negative values. The expected result is -3.1363636363636362. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the values might be incorrectly set as negative.

Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Values

Details:
  TestName: testAverageWithMaxValues.
  Description: This test is to validate the average calculation when maximum values are set for a and b.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use setA and setB methods to set maximum values (for example, a=Double.MAX_VALUE and b=Double.MAX_VALUE).
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the average calculation with maximum values. The expected result is Double.MAX_VALUE. This test is significant as it tests the scenario where the maximum possible values are used.

public class StudentGradeGetAverageTest {
/*
The test `testAverageWithNormalValues` is failing because the expected output and the actual output of the `getAverage` function are not equal. The test is expecting the output of the `getAverage` function to be `3.1363636363636362` but the actual output is `2.6818181818181817`.

The `getAverage` function calculates the average as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. In the test, `studentGrade.setA(2.0)` and `studentGrade.setB(3.0)` are called but `studentGrade.setC(...)` is not called, which means `c` is `null` (or possibly `0.0` if it's a primitive type).

This discrepancy in the expected and actual values is due to the value of `c` not being set in the test. If `c` was set to a value such that the average would have been `3.1363636363636362`, the test would have passed. As a result, the test is failing because the expected output was calculated using a different value of `c` than what is actually being used in the test.

/*
The test failure is due to an assertion error. The test method `testAverageWithNegativeValues` is testing the `getAverage` method with negative values. The issue here is that the expected value provided in the test case does not match the actual value returned by the `getAverage` method. 

The expected value in the test case is -3.1363636363636362. However, when the `getAverage` method is called with `a = -2.0`, `b = -3.0`, and `c = null` (default value of private double in JAVA), it returns -2.6818181818181817. This is because the `getAverage` method calculates the average as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`, which results in -2.6818181818181817 for the given inputs.

The test case is failing because the expected value is incorrect. The test should pass if the expected value is updated to match the correct output of the `getAverage` method with the provided inputs.

/*
The test is failing because it's expecting the average of `Double.MAX_VALUE`, `Double.MAX_VALUE`, and `0` (since value of `c` is not set, it defaults to `0.0`) to be `Double.MAX_VALUE`. However, the calculation in the `getAverage()` method results in a value which is higher than `Double.MAX_VALUE` causing it to return `Infinity`.

Here's why this is happening:

In the `getAverage()` method, `a`, `b`, and `c` are multiplied by `2.0`, `3.0` and `5.0` respectively before being added together and divided by `10.0`. When `a` and `b` are both set to `Double.MAX_VALUE`, their calculated values become larger than `Double.MAX_VALUE` which results in `Infinity` when added together. Dividing `Infinity` by `10.0` still results in `Infinity`.

The test is expecting the result to be `Double.MAX_VALUE`, but it's actually getting `Infinity`, hence the failure. The test case doesn't consider the fact that the arithmetic operations in the `getAverage()` method can result in a value larger than `Double.MAX_VALUE` when `a` and/or `b` are set to `Double.MAX_VALUE`.
