================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
Issue: The method getAverage() calculates an average without checking if the variables 'a' and 'b' have been initialized. This can lead to incorrect calculations if these variables are null.
Solution: Ensure that the variables 'a' and 'b' are initialized before they are used in calculations. You can do this by adding a constructor to your class that initializes 'a' and 'b' or by adding null checks in your method.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: The method getAverage() performs a division operation. If the denominator is zero, this will result in a DivideByZero exception, causing the application to crash.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that the denominator is not zero before performing the division operation.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The current code does not have any debug information, which can make it difficult to troubleshoot issues. This is not a security vulnerability, but it is a best practice to include debug information in your code.
Solution: Include debug information in your code. This can be done by using the 'Logger' class in Java.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with a and b as positive integers

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithPositiveIntegers
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are positive integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as positive integers.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is the expected average.
Validation: This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are positive integers. This is important as it reflects the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test with a and b as negative integers

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithNegativeIntegers
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are negative integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as negative integers.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is the expected average.
Validation: This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are negative integers. This is important because the method should work correctly regardless of the sign of the numbers.

Scenario 3: Test with a and b as zero

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithZero
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as zero.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
Validation: This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are zero. This is important because the method should return zero when both inputs are zero.

Scenario 4: Test with a as positive and b as negative

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithPositiveAndNegative
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when a is positive and b is negative.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a as a positive integer and b as a negative integer.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is the expected average.
Validation: This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the average when a is positive and b is negative. This is important because the method should work correctly regardless of the sign of the numbers.

Scenario 5: Test with a and b as maximum and minimum integer values

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithMaxAndMinIntegers
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when a is the maximum integer value and b is the minimum integer value.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a as Integer.MAX_VALUE and b as Integer.MIN_VALUE.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Assert that the returned value is the expected average.
Validation: This test verifies that the method correctly calculates the average when a is the maximum integer value and b is the minimum integer value. This is important because the method should work correctly regardless of the size of the numbers.
