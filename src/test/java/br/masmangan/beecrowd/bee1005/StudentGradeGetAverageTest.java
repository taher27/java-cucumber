ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getAverage_5d8b4919d3

Scenario 1: Test with a and b as positive integers

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithPositiveIntegers
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are positive integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as positive integers.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify if the method accurately computes the average according to the formula. The expected result is based on the calculation: (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles positive integers correctly.

Scenario 2: Test with a and b as negative integers

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithNegativeIntegers
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are negative integers.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as negative integers.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify if the method accurately computes the average even with negative integers. The expected result is based on the calculation: (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles negative integers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with a and b as zero

Details:
TestName: testAverageWithZeros
Description: This test is meant to check if the getAverage method correctly calculates the average when both a and b are zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Set a and b as zero.
Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify if the method returns zero when both inputs are zero. The expected result is zero as per the formula: (a * 3.5 + b * 7.5) / 11.0. This test is significant to ensure that the method handles zero inputs correctly.
