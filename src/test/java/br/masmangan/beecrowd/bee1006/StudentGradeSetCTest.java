Scenario 1: Test setting a positive value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetPositiveC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a positive number is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to set up any data, mocks or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a positive number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c is the same as the positive number passed.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a positive number is passed. The expected result is that the value of c should be the same as the positive number passed. This is significant as it shows that the method is working as expected when setting positive values.

Scenario 2: Test setting a negative value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativeC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a negative number is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to set up any data, mocks or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with a negative number.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c is the same as the negative number passed.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a negative number is passed. The expected result is that the value of c should be the same as the negative number passed. This is significant as it shows that the method is working as expected when setting negative values.

Scenario 3: Test setting zero value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetZeroC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when zero is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to set up any data, mocks or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the setC method with zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method setC correctly sets the value of c when zero is passed. The expected result is that the value of c should be zero. This is significant as it shows that the method is working as expected when setting zero as value.
