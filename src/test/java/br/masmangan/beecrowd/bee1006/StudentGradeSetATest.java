Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Value of a is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfAIsCorrectlySet
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly assigns the value to the instance variable 'a'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies whether the value of 'a' is correctly set by the method. The expected result is the correct assignment of the value to 'a'. This test is significant as it ensures the basic functionality of the 'setA' method.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the Method Handles Negative Values

Details:
    TestName: testMethodHandlesNegativeValues
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly handles negative values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized negative value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies whether the method can handle negative values. The expected result is the correct assignment of the negative value to 'a'. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the method.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if the Method Handles Zero Value

Details:
    TestName: testMethodHandlesZeroValue
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly handles a zero value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a zero value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized zero value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies whether the method can handle a zero value. The expected result is the correct assignment of the zero value to 'a'. This test is significant as it checks the ability of the method to handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test to Check if the Method Handles Large Values

Details:
    TestName: testMethodHandlesLargeValues
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the method 'setA' correctly handles large values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a large value for 'a'.
    Act: Invoke the setA method with the initialized large value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual value of 'a' against the expected value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies whether the method can handle large values. The expected result is the correct assignment of the large value to 'a'. This test is significant as it checks the scalability of the method.
