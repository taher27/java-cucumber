"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The test case `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is failing because the expected result does not match the actual result. The test case is expecting the result of the `getAverage` method to be `3.7`, but the actual result is `3.8`.

The `getAverage` method is calculating the average of the grades as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the inputs `a=2.0`, `b=3.0`, and `c=5.0`, the calculation becomes `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0`, which equals `3.8`. 

Therefore, the test case is failing because the expected value `3.7` is incorrect. The correct expected value should be `3.8` based on the given inputs and the algorithm in the `getAverage` method. 

The solution to this issue is to correct the expected value in the test case to `3.8`. This will ensure that the test case accurately validates the `getAverage` method with the provided inputs.

/*
The test case `testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades` is failing because the expected result does not match the actual result. The test case is expecting the average to be `-3.7` but the actual average computed by the `getAverage` method is `-3.8`.

The `getAverage` method calculates the average as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the input values of `a = -2.0`, `b = -3.0`, and `c = -5.0`, the calculation becomes `((-2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (-5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0`, which results in `-3.8`.

The issue here is not with the business logic or any compilation/build failures, it's simply that the expected result is incorrect in the test case. The test case should expect `-3.8` as the result, not `-3.7`.

/*
The test `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing due to the assertion error. The expected output of the `getAverage` method is 2.3 but the actual output is 2.0. The `getAverage` method is calculating the average based on the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. 

In the test, we are setting the values of a, b, and c as 2.0, -3.0, and 5.0 respectively. Substituting these values in the formula, the result is `((2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0`, which equals to 2.0, not 2.3. 

Therefore, the assertion `assertEquals(2.3, result, 0.001)` is failing because the expected value 2.3 is not equal to the actual calculated value 2.0. 

The test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual results of the method under test, not because of any compilation or build failures. The method `getAverage()` is working as expected based on its current implementation. If the expected result is supposed to be 2.3 based on the business requirements, then there might be an error in the calculation logic of `getAverage()`. If the method's calculation is correct, then the expected result in the test case needs to be adjusted.
