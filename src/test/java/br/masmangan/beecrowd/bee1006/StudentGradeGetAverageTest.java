"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect assertion in the test case. The test case is expecting the value of the average to be 3.7, but the actual result returned by the method is 3.8.

The getAverage() method in the business logic calculates the average as (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. Given the values of a, b, and c in the test case as 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 respectively, the expected average should be:

(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 3.8

Therefore, the expected value in the assertion of the test case should be 3.8, not 3.7. The test failure is not due to any compilation error, business logic issue, or external dependencies. It is simply because of an incorrect expectation in the test case.

/*
The test failure is due to an incorrect assertion in the test case. The test case is trying to assert that the average of the given negative grades (-2.0, -3.0, and -5.0) is -3.7, but the actual result of the getAverage() method is -3.8. 

The getAverage() method calculates the average as ((a * 2.0) + (b * 3.0) + (c * 5.0)) / 10.0. Using the values from the test case, the calculation would be ((-2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (-5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0, which equals -3.8, not -3.7 as the test case is asserting.

Therefore, the test case fails with an AssertionFailedError, as the expected result (-3.7) does not match the actual result (-3.8). The test case should be updated to assert the correct expected result.

/*
The test case 'testAverageWithMixedGrades' failed because the expected output and the actual output of the method 'getAverage' did not match. The 'getAverage' method is performing the operation as expected and returning the correct result.

The problem lies within the test case itself where it expected the value to be 2.3 but the method returned 2.0. The average is calculated based on the weights provided in the getAverage method, which are 2 for 'a', 3 for 'b' and 5 for 'c'. The calculation is (2*2.0 + 3*-3.0 + 5*5.0) / 10 = 2.0, which is correct.

Therefore, the test case assertion is incorrect. The test case expected the output to be 2.3, but the correct expected output should be 2.0. Hence, the test case failed.

    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
