================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The code is using double for arithmetic operations. This can lead to precision loss and incorrect results, potentially leading to logical errors in the application.
Solution: Consider using BigDecimal for arithmetic operations to avoid precision loss. Also, validate all input data before performing arithmetic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method getAverage() takes no parameters and relies on instance variables a, b, and c. If these variables are not properly controlled or validated, they could introduce security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that all input data is validated and sanitized before use. Consider making the method take parameters directly, so the source of the data is more explicit.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: If the denominator in the division operation is zero, this will result in a DivideByZero error, potentially crashing the application.
Solution: Add a check to ensure the denominator is not zero before performing the division operation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test getAverage method with positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the correctness of the method getAverage when all the inputs a, b, and c are positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up values for a, b, and c as positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average when the inputs are positive numbers. The expected result is based on the given formula. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method can handle common, valid input and produce the correct output.

Scenario 2: Test getAverage method with negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the correctness of the getAverage method when all the inputs a, b, and c are negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up values for a, b, and c as negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average when the inputs are negative numbers. The expected result is based on the given formula. This test is important to ensure that the method can handle negative numbers correctly.

Scenario 3: Test getAverage method with zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the correctness of the getAverage method when one or more of the inputs a, b, and c are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up values for a, b, and/or c as zero.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average when one or more inputs are zero. The expected result is based on the given formula. This test is significant because it checks the behavior of the method when dealing with zero, which could potentially be a special case.

Scenario 4: Test getAverage method with extreme large numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithLargeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the correctness of the getAverage method when the inputs a, b, and c are extremely large numbers to test the boundary conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up values for a, b, and c as extremely large numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the average when the inputs are extremely large numbers. The expected result is based on the given formula. This test is important to ensure that the method can handle extreme cases without throwing any errors or exceptions.
