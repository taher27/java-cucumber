"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The failure of the test `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is due to an incorrect expectation in the test assertion. The test is failing on the assertion line where it compares the expected value with the actual value returned by the `getAverage()` method. 

The assertion error message "expected: <3.7> but was: <3.8>" indicates that the test was expecting the `getAverage()` method to return `3.7`, but it actually returned `3.8`. 

Looking at the implementation of the `getAverage()` method, it correctly calculates the weighted average of `a`, `b`, and `c` as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. With the inputs `a=2.0`, `b=3.0`, and `c=5.0`, the correct average should indeed be `3.8` and not `3.7` as the test expects. 

Therefore, the test is failing because of an incorrect expectation and not due to any issues with the business logic or external dependencies. The test should be updated to expect `3.8` instead of `3.7`.

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();

    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(3.7, result, 0.001);

/*
The failure of the test `testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades` is due to an incorrect expectation. The test is expecting the average to be `-3.7` but the actual result is `-3.8`. This is due to the way the average is calculated in the `getAverage()` method.

The `getAverage()` method calculates the weighted average of `a`, `b`, and `c` with weights 2, 3, and 5 respectively. So the average is calculated as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` in the test are `-2.0`, `-3.0`, and `-5.0` respectively, the calculated average would be `(-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0` which equals `-3.8` not `-3.7` as expected in the test.

So the test is failing because the expected value is incorrect. The expected value should be `-3.8` not `-3.7`.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades() {
    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(-5.0);
    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(-3.7, result, 0.001);
}

/*
The test `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing because the expected output value does not match the actual output value. 

The test is trying to assert that the average grade, calculated with the `getAverage` method, is 2.3. However, the method is returning 2.0, which is causing the test to fail. 

Looking at the method's implementation, it's clear that the `getAverage` method calculates the weighted average of the three grades (a, b, c) with weights 2, 3 and 5 respectively. With the input values of 2.0 for `a`, -3.0 for `b`, and 5.0 for `c`, the calculated average is indeed 2.0, not 2.3. 

Therefore, the test is failing because the expected outcome in the test case is incorrect. The test case should expect 2.0 as the result, not 2.3, given the input values and the method's implementation.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testAverageWithMixedGrades() {
    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(5.0);
    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(2.3, result, 0.001);
