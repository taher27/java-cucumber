"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
The failure of the test `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is due to an incorrect expectation in the test assertion. The test is expecting the average to be `3.7` but the actual result is `3.8`.

In the `getAverage` method, the average is calculated as `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the values `a=2.0`, `b=3.0`, and `c=5.0`, the average would be `(2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 3.8`. 

Therefore, the test assertion `assertEquals(3.7, result, 0.001);` is incorrect because it expects the result to be `3.7` when the actual result is `3.8`. This discrepancy is what's causing the test to fail. 

To fix the issue, the expected value in the test assertion should be changed to `3.8`.

/*
The failure of the test `testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades` is due to an incorrect expectation in the test assertion. The test is failing on the assertion line where it compares the expected value with the actual value returned by the `getAverage` method. 

The assertion error message "expected: <-3.7> but was: <-3.8>" indicates that the test was expecting the `getAverage` method to return -3.7, but it actually returned -3.8. 

Given the implementation of the `getAverage` method, the calculation is correct. The method calculates the weighted average of the grades as follows: `(-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0`, which results in -3.8. 

Therefore, the test case is incorrect because it expects -3.7 while the correct weighted average is -3.8. The test needs to be corrected to expect -3.8 as the result.

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(-2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(-5.0);
    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(-3.7, result, 0.001);

/*
The test `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing because the expected output value does not match the actual output value. 

The test is trying to assert that the average grade, calculated with the `getAverage` method, is 2.3. However, the method is returning 2.0, which is causing the test to fail. 

Looking at the method's implementation, it's clear that the `getAverage` method calculates the weighted average of the grades a, b, and c with respective weights of 2, 3 and 5, then divides the total by 10. Given the inputs a=2.0, b=-3.0, and c=5.0, the actual output will be 2.0, not 2.3. 

So, the test is failing because the expected output value in the test case is incorrect. The expected value should be 2.0, not 2.3.

@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testAverageWithMixedGrades() {
    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();
    studentGrade.setA(2.0);
    studentGrade.setB(-3.0);
    studentGrade.setC(5.0);
    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(2.3, result, 0.001);
