"""
  Scenario 1: Normal case where all grades are positive

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with positive numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are positive. This is a basic functionality check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 2: Case where all grades are zero

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllZeroGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with zero using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are zero. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 3: Case where all grades are negative

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when all grades a, b, c are negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when all grades are negative. This is an edge case check for the getAverage() method.

  Scenario 4: Case where grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers

  Details:
    TestName: testAverageWithMixedGrades.
    Description: This test checks the average calculation when grades a, b, c are a mix of positive and negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a, b and c with a mix of positive and negative numbers using setA(), setB() and setC() methods respectively.
    Act: Call getAverage() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the average is calculated correctly when grades are a mix of positive and negative numbers. This is another functionality check for the getAverage() method.

/*
Based on the provided error logs, the test `testAverageWithAllPositiveGrades` is failing due to an assertion error. The test expects the value of the average to be 3.7, but the actual result returned by the method `getAverage()` is 3.8. 

The `getAverage()` method calculates the average using the formula (a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0. Given the inputs a=2.0, b=3.0 and c=5.0, the correct average should be (2.0 * 2.0 + 3.0 * 3.0 + 5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0 = 3.8. 

Therefore, the test is failing because of an incorrect expected value in the test case. The expected value in the test case should be updated to 3.8 to match the correct result from the `getAverage()` method.

Based on the error log, the test case `testAverageWithAllNegativeGrades` is failing due to an assertion error. The test case is expecting the result of `studentGrade.getAverage()` to be `-3.7` but the actual returned value is `-3.8`. 

In the `getAverage` method, the calculation is `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. Given the values of `a=-2.0`, `b=-3.0`, `c=-5.0`, the expected result would be `(-2.0 * 2.0 + -3.0 * 3.0 + -5.0 * 5.0) / 10.0`, which indeed equals `-3.8`, not `-3.7`. 

Therefore, the test case is failing because the expected value in the assertion (`-3.7`) is incorrect. The correct expected value should be `-3.8`. The business logic and the test function are compiling and running fine, it's just the expected value in the test case that is causing the test failure.

/*
The test `testAverageWithMixedGrades` is failing due to an assertion error. The expected output of the test was 2.3, but the actual output returned by the `getAverage` method was 2.0. 

This discrepancy arises from the logic used to calculate the average in the `getAverage` method. The method calculates the average using the formula `(a * 2.0 + b * 3.0 + c * 5.0) / 10.0`. The test inputs are `a = 2.0`, `b = -3.0`, and `c = 5.0`. As per the method logic, the result will be `((2.0 * 2.0) + (-3.0 * 3.0) + (5.0 * 5.0)) / 10.0 = 2.0`, which is exactly what the method is returning.

The problem here is not with the method, but with the test case's expectation. The expected value is set to 2.3, which doesn't match with the calculated value of 2.0 according to the method's logic. Hence, the test case assertion is failing. The expected value in the test case should be corrected to match the method's logic in order to pass the test.

    StudentGrade studentGrade = new StudentGrade();

    double result = studentGrade.getAverage();
    assertEquals(2.3, result, 0.001);
