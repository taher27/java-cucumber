Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Value of B is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly assigns the value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly assigns the value to the variable 'b'. This is important to ensure that the correct value of 'b' is used in subsequent computations or operations in the class.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the Value of B is Reassigned Correctly

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsReassignedCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly reassigns a new value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'b' and then initialize a new value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the first initialized value and then with the second initialized value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the second initialized value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly reassigns a new value to the variable 'b'. This is important to ensure that the correct value of 'b' is used in subsequent computations or operations in the class when the value of 'b' is changed.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if the Negative Value of B is Set Correctly

Details:
    TestName: testNegativeValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly assigns a negative value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized negative value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the initialized negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly assigns a negative value to the variable 'b'. This is important to ensure that the correct value of 'b' is used in subsequent computations or operations in the class when 'b' is negative.
