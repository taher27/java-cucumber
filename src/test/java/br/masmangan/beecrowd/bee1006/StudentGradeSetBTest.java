================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setter function setB(double b) does not validate the input 'b'. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if 'b' contains unexpected values.
Solution: Implement input validation in the setter method to ensure the input 'b' is within expected range or format.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setter function setB(double b) directly modifies a private attribute. If this method is exposed or accessible inappropriately, it could lead to unauthorized modification of the attribute.
Solution: Ensure proper access control is enforced on the setter methods. Keep them as 'private' or 'protected' as much as possible and expose them only when necessary through public methods.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Check if the Value of B is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly assigns the value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the initialized value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly assigns the value to the variable 'b'. This is important to ensure that the correct value of 'b' is used in subsequent operations.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if Negative Value of B is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testNegativeValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly assigns a negative value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a negative value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized negative value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the initialized negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly assigns a negative value to the variable 'b'. This is crucial to ensure that the correct negative value of 'b' is used in subsequent operations.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if Zero Value of B is Correctly Set

Details:
    TestName: testZeroValueOfBIsSetCorrectly
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method 'setB' correctly assigns a zero value to the instance variable 'b'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a zero value for 'b'.
    Act: Invoke the 'setB' method with the initialized zero value.
    Assert: Assert that the value of 'b' in the class is equal to the initialized zero value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'setB' method correctly assigns a zero value to the variable 'b'. This is crucial to ensure that the correct zero value of 'b' is used in subsequent operations.
