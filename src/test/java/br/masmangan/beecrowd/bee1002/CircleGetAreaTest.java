Scenario 1: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is zero

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle when the radius is set to zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to zero using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area is zero.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a radius of zero is indeed zero. This test is significant in validating the correctness of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a radius of zero.

Scenario 2: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is a positive number

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle when the radius is set to a positive number.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to a positive number using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area matches the expected result.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is correctly calculated. This test is significant in validating the correctness of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a positive radius.

Scenario 3: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is a negative number

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly handles the scenario when the radius is set to a negative number, as the radius of a circle cannot be negative.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to a negative number using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area is NaN (Not a Number), indicating an invalid calculation.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a negative radius cannot be calculated. This test is significant in validating the error handling capabilities of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a negative radius.

/*
The test case is failing because the business logic does not handle the case of a negative radius correctly. 

In the test case, a circle is created with a radius of -5. The area of a circle with a negative radius is mathematically undefined, and the test case expects the `getArea()` method to return NaN (Not a Number) in this case. However, the `getArea()` method in the business logic does not check if the radius is negative before calculating the area. It simply calculates the area as PI * radius * radius, which will return a positive value for a negative radius because the square of a negative number is positive. 

Thus, the value returned by `getArea()` is not NaN, which causes the assertion in the test case to fail. The error message "The area of a circle with negative radius should be NaN ==> expected: <true> but was: <false>" indicates that the assertion `assertTrue(Double.isNaN(area))` failed because `Double.isNaN(area)` was false.

To fix this issue, the `getArea()` method needs to be modified to return NaN if the radius is negative.
@Test

    Circle circle = new Circle();
    circle.setRadius(-5);
    double area = circle.getArea();
    assertTrue(Double.isNaN(area), "The area of a circle with negative radius should be NaN");
