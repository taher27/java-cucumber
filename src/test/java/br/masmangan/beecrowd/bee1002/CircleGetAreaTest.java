================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If PI or radius values are provided by user input or calculated in an insecure way, it may lead to predictable outputs which can be exploited.
Solution: Ensure that all input values are properly sanitized and validated. If randomness is required, use a secure random number generator.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: If the radius is zero, the division by zero will cause an ArithmeticException.
Solution: Include checks to ensure the radius is not zero before performing the division operation.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: If the radius is very large, the multiplication can result in a value that exceeds the maximum limit for doubles, leading to incorrect calculations.
Solution: Ensure that the radius value is within the acceptable range for doubles before performing the calculation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to calculate the area of a circle with a positive radius value

Details:
  TestName: testGetAreaWithPositiveRadius.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getArea method when the radius of the circle is a positive value. The expected scenario is the calculation of the area of a circle with a positive radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the radius with a positive value.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: Assert the result with the expected area of the circle.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle with a positive radius. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula for the area of a circle. This test is significant in validating the basic functionality of the getArea method.

Scenario 2: Test to calculate the area of a circle with a zero radius

Details:
  TestName: testGetAreaWithZeroRadius.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getArea method when the radius of the circle is zero. The expected scenario is the calculation of the area of a circle with a zero radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the radius with a zero value.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: Assert the result with the expected area of the circle.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle with a zero radius. The expected result is zero, as a circle with a zero radius has no area. This test is significant in validating the behavior of the getArea method with edge case inputs.

Scenario 3: Test to calculate the area of a circle with a negative radius

Details:
  TestName: testGetAreaWithNegativeRadius.
  Description: This test is meant to check the getArea method when the radius of the circle is a negative value. The expected scenario is the calculation of the area of a circle with a negative radius.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the radius with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getArea method.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getArea method throws an exception when the radius of the circle is a negative value. The expected result is an exception, as a circle cannot have a negative radius. This test is significant in validating error handling in the getArea method.
