"""
Scenario 1: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is zero

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithZeroRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle when the radius is set to zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to zero using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area is zero.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a radius of zero is indeed zero. This test is significant in validating the correctness of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a radius of zero.

Scenario 2: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is a positive number

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithPositiveRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly calculates the area of a circle when the radius is set to a positive number.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to a positive number using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area matches the expected result.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a positive radius is correctly calculated. This test is significant in validating the correctness of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a positive radius.

Scenario 3: Validate the area of the circle when the radius is a negative number

Details:
TestName: testAreaWithNegativeRadius
Description: This test is meant to check if the getArea method correctly handles the scenario when the radius is set to a negative number, as the radius of a circle cannot be negative.
Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a Circle object and set the radius to a negative number using setRadius method.
Act: Invoke the getArea method on the Circle object.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned area is NaN (Not a Number), indicating an invalid calculation.
Validation:
The assertion verifies that the area of a circle with a negative radius cannot be calculated. This test is significant in validating the error handling capabilities of the getArea method when calculating the area of a circle with a negative radius.
