Scenario 1: Test to Check the Normal Working of the setRadius Method

Details:
    TestName: testSetRadiusNormalWorking.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setRadius method is correctly setting the radius for a given value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly setting a value.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with a valid double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius is set to the provided value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the radius value is correctly set by the method. This is essential to ensure the correct working of the application when setting or changing the radius value.

Scenario 2: Test to Check the setRadius Method with Zero

Details:
    TestName: testSetRadiusWithZero.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setRadius method is correctly setting the radius when provided with zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly setting a value.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius is set to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the radius value is correctly set to zero by the method. This is significant in scenarios where the radius may need to be reset or initialized to zero.

Scenario 3: Test to Check the setRadius Method with Negative Value

Details:
    TestName: testSetRadiusWithNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setRadius method is handling negative values correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as we are directly setting a value.
    Act: Invoke the setRadius method with a negative double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the radius is set to the negative value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the radius value is correctly set to the negative value by the method. This is essential in understanding how the application handles negative inputs for radius.
